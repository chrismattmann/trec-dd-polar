# TREC Dynamic Domain Polar Dataset

## Purpose of data:

Climate change is amplified in the Polar Regions.  Polar amplification is captured via space and airborne remote sensing, in-situ measurement, and climate modeling. Beyond the rich literature that documents changing Polar regions, each method of Polar-data collection produces a diverse set of data types, ranging from text-based metadata to more complex data structures (e.g. HDF, NetCDF, GRIB). Because finding these data is often a primary challenge in scientific discovery, inclusion of the Polar dataset in TREC-DD would help advance science through data discovery and provide TREC-DD a new challenge in in the realm of search relevancy. 

## Dataset Description:

This dataset is a collection of web crawls from three primary sources: 
>1. Dr. Chris Mattmann's crawl of [ADE](http://nsidc.org/acadis/search/), performed at the [Open Science Codefest](http://nceas.github.io/open-science-codefest/) and at the [NSF DataViz Hackathon for Polar CyberInfrastructure](http://nsf-polar-cyberinfrastructure.github.io/datavis-hackathon/)
>2. Dr. Mattmann's student [Angela Wang](https://github.com/snowangelwmy/), contributed 3 datasets: [2 crawls of ACADIS and one of NASA AMD](https://github.com/snowangelwmy/csci572dr).
>3. Dr. Mattmann's [CSCI 572 Course at USC](http://sunset.usc.edu/classes/cs572_2015/), students submitted 13 individual crawls of NASA ACADIS, NSIDC ADE, and AMD.

Each web crawl used [Apache Nutch](http://nutch.apache.org/) as the core framework for web crawling and [Apache Tika](http://tika.apache.org/) as the main content detection and extraction framework. Nutch is a distributed search engine that runs on top of [Apache Hadoop](http://hadoop.apache.org/). Apache Tika is an open source framework for metadata exploration, automatic text mining, and information retrieval.

Web crawls were focused on three polar data repositories: the National Science Foundation Advanced Cooperative Arctic Data and Information System ([ACADIS](https://www.aoncadis.org/home.htm)), the National Snow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC) Arctic Data Explorer ([ADE](http://nsidc.org/acadis/search/)), and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration Antarctic Master Directory ([AMD](http://gcmd.gsfc.nasa.gov/KeywordSearch/Home.do?Portal=amd&MetadataType=0)).  

The finished Polar dataset is composed of 17 distinct web crawls, containing 1,741,530 records (158 GB) across the three Polar science data repositories, which themselves are largely uncoordinated.

## Processing Crawled Data:

### Duplicate Records
Exact duplicate records were removed using signature based methods.  Algorithms and accompanying code were developed to remove near duplicates, using jaccard similarity, by graduate students in USC CS572. However, not all teams that submitted web crawls to this dataset applied their jaccard-similarity algorithms.

### Data Format:

Crawled data were put into Common Crawl Format, acording to Memex format, using the [CommonCrawlDataDumper](https://wiki.apache.org/nutch/CommonCrawlDataDumper). The CommonCrawlDataDumper is an Apache Nutch tool that can dump Nutch segments into Common Crawl data format, mapping each crawled-by-Nutch file on a JSON-based data structure. CommonCrawlDataDumper dumps out the files and serialize them with CBOR encoding, a data representation format used in many contexts.

Each contributed web crawl has an accompanying JSON file that lists the total records, by mimeType. A program, aggregate.py, aggregates all of the JSON files.  Total records at time of generation are provided below:
